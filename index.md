Nnedi Okorafor’s _Lagoon_ (2014) regularly establishes and crosses boundaries. It is a novel of change, from cellular to societal, and those changes are largely sparked and continued by feminine- bodied characters. Because of the interplay between human and nonhuman beings, the term ‘women’ is too narrow for this novel. The text shows how theories involving feminism and the nonhuman complicate and expand on each other. The idea of ‘otherness’ is central to the theories and the text, challenging more traditional constructions of mankind, the reader, and agency. Three characters in particular, the swordfish, Adaora, and Ayodele, embody boundary-crossing identities and changes. Ultimately, they represent the three acts of the novel, welcome, awakening, and symbiosis, and they demonstrate that because everything is connected, humanity must be careful to act in harmony with the nonhuman for the sake of all involved.

When HIV/AIDS infections and deaths ballooned and became part of the public consciousness in the 1980s in the US and UK, fear drove many individuals’ and institutions’ responses. This fear permeates HIV/AIDS literature and conversation to this day. Larry Kramer wrote _The Normal Heart_ in the heart of the epidemic, while he and his community in New York were suffering. HIV does not yet have a cure, though treatments have been developed, yet the literature about people’s experiences around the disease are still centred in the ’80s. Russell T. Davies’ TV series _It’s a Sin_ was only released in 2021, but it is also set in ’80s London. Both texts are filled with individual characters wrestling with fears of contagion, both medical and reputational, and ethical questions. Each text has its own purpose and perspective, leading to praise and criticism, but both make real the nuanced reality of living through this time, which is especially important for the younger generations that were not there. Overall, The Normal Heart shows people’s struggles to make the right choice and take the right action in public and private spheres, depending on what power they do or do not have; It’s a Sin demonstrates changing perspectives as scientific and public understanding increases and the effect those improvements have on everyday lives.

Studies of the Persian Empire have to grapple with the state of surviving evidence, which is somewhat lacking in the areas of the empire itself. Much of what is referenced comes from Greek sources, which are biased and tend to look down on Persia. A long-standing claim is that the Persian Court was nomadic because it changed location with the seasons. Further analysis, however, reveals that the court was more likely itinerant, in that it did move often, but not necessarily with the seasons. Other reasons included military needs and asserting control over the vast lands and number of peoples. The court had both permanent residences and tent encampments, showing the bridge between ancestral nomadism and what eventually became settled living. The Achaemenid Persian Court was itinerant, more likely moving strategically than with the seasons.
